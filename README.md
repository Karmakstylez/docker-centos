CentOS 8 Stream Docker image
============================

We're all divided with recent decision on changing CentOS into rolling distro. As there are no official Docker images with Stream variant, I created them on my own, based on [official instruction](https://www.centos.org/centos-stream/). Now at least I can try it and decide on my own if it's stable enough for production workloads.

You can fetch docker image from:
* [tgagor/centos-stream](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/tgagor/centos-stream)
* ghcr.io/tgagor/centos-stream
